    <p> The gear profiles in this folder were generated using the free gear
      profile generator tool
      at <a href="http://hessmer.org/gears/InvoluteSpurGearBuilder.html">http://hessmer.org/gears/InvoluteSpurGearBuilder.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The parameters were chosen to correspond to common "24 pitch" gears with 14.5
      degree pressure angle, although the actual DXFs use metric units.  These gears
      have has 24 teeth per 1 inch of pitch circle diameter.</p>

    <p>The pitch circle circumference is the pitch diameter multiplied pi = 1.0 * pi = pi.</p>

    <p>The circular pitch p is the distance between teeth along the pitch circle:</p>

    <pre>
      p  = (1.0 * pi) / 24
      = 0.1308996938995747 inches
      = 3.3248522250491974 mm
    </pre>

    <p>The gear profiles were generated using the following parameters:</p>
    <pre>
      3.32485 mm	circular pitch
      14.5 degree	pressure angle
      0.1 mm		clearance
      0.1 mm		backlash
      0.0 mm		profile shift
      6.35 mm		center hole (1/4 inch)
    </pre>  

    <p>DXF profiles were generated as follows:</p>
    <pre>
      teeth	pitch diameter
      84	3.50 inch      
      24	1.00 inch
      18	0.75 inch
      12	0.50 inch
    </pre>

    <p>Note: the files were generated in <b>millimeters</b> but describe a
      standard inch gear size.  Such is life in the USA: the rest of the world
      just uses millimeters now, but inch-sized parts are easier and cheaper to
      buy here.<p>
