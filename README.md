===================

This repository provides SolidWorks CAD examples for the Introduction to
Physical Computing course at Carnegie Mellon University.  This course is being
offered for the first time in Fall 2014 as part of the new IDeATe program.  For
details, see [www.cmu.edu/ideate](http://www.cmu.edu/ideate/).  All materials

A following open-source designs for OpenBeam and related components were
downloaded from thingiverse.com and are subject to the original licensing terms:

      OpenBeam_1515_Extrusion_V2
      OpenBeam_L_Bracket
      OpenBeam_T_Bracket

A few useful parts have been provided by the instructors.

      gear_library

The gear parts were generated using [a free online tool](http://hessmer.org/gears/InvoluteSpurGearBuilder.html).

The folders labeled 'example' are designed to highlight principles of mechanical
design for the course.  These are not necessarily fully realized designs ready
to fabricate, they are demonstrations and building blocks.

      spokes_example
      turntable_example

For now, the parts are all drawn using SolidWorks Education Edition 2012-2013 /
2012 SP 5.0 (a slightly older version).
