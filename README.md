A few useful parts have been provided by the instructors.

      library_parts	        Simplified standard small parts (bearings, spacers, etc.)
      gear_library	        A few sample gears generated using an online tool.

The gear parts were generated using <http://hessmer.org/gears/InvoluteSpurGearBuilder.html>

The folders labeled 'example' are designed to highlight principles of mechanical
design for the course.  These are not necessarily fully realized designs ready
to fabricate, they are demonstrations and building blocks.

	  linkage_example	    Four-bar linkage to demonstrate underconstrained assemblies
	  pendulum_example	    Extrusion structure with ball-bearing clevis pin joint and a fixed T-joint.
	  spokes_example	    Laser-cuttable joining plates for building complext extrusion structures.
	  turntable_example	    Motor and gear example using a ball-bearing supported shaft and parallel plate structure.
	  wedge_examples    	Examples of laser-cuttable wedge-and-slot structures for creating rigid 3D structures from flat parts.

A following open-source designs for OpenBeam and related components were
downloaded from thingiverse.com and are subject to the original licensing terms:

      OpenBeam_1515_Extrusion_V2
      OpenBeam_L_Bracket
      OpenBeam_T_Bracket
