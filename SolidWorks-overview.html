    <h1>SolidWorks Overview for Intro to Physical Computing</h1>

    <p>We have several CAD
      (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">computer-aided
      design</a>) tools available for designing physical structures,
      namely <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com/">Rhino</a>
      and <a href="http://www.solidworks.com/">SolidWorks</a>.  This overview is
      intended as a high-level introduction to the essential features of
      SolidWorks which make it useful for this course.</p>

    <p>SolidWorks is a <em>parametric</em> design tool.  In the broadest sense,
      this makes it closer to visual programming than drawing: parts are defined
      by geometric <b>sketch</b> primitives constrained by <b>relations</b> and
      processed into geometric <b>features</b> through operations.  So a
      cylindrical part might be defined by a circle on a plane that is extruded
      for a given distance or up to a given point.  Unlike Rhino, that tree of
      elements is what <em>defines</em> the part and is kept through the life of
      the part.  So if that circle is moved, or split or rehaped, or the
      extrusion distance changed, the geometry of the solid form can be
      recomputed.</p>

    <p>Using parametric design efficiently involves structuring the part model
      so that it accurately captures <em>design intent</em>.  E.g. if two
      particular holes are mechanically related, their relative position can be
      defined by dimensions and relations which capture that mechanical
      relationship. That way, if other features change and the part shape
      changes, the holes can maintain their relationship and preserve the
      intent.</p>

    <p>SolidWorks is especially suited for designing <b>assemblies</b>
      of <b>parts</b>.  Machines are typically built from individually
      manufactured parts assembled together.  This is captured in the design
      model by creating assemblies which define the relative position of
      individual parts via <b>mates</b> which define geometric constraints.
      For example, a shaft can be mated to a bearing hole by a concentric mate
      which limits it to axial rotation and translation (2 remaining freedoms),
      then further limited by a co-planarity mate between a groove face,
      snap-ring face, and bearing face which then leaves only axial rotation
      free.  If mates correctly correspond to actual physical constraints, the
      model helps visualize that all parts have the correct freedoms.  And the
      parametric nature of the constraint tree means that many part dimensions
      can be changed and other part positions can adapt.</p>

    <p>A negative side-effect of the parametric <b>feature tree</b> is that if
      the structure of the the design intent changes, it can be difficult to
      modify the tree structure to match.  This is because all features are
      defined in relation to existing features, so if a <b>parent feature</b> is
      removed, the <b>child feature</b> becomes only partly defined.  It takes a
      great deal of practice to learn to structure models well at the beginning
      to minimize these problems later.</p>

    <h3>Essential Ideas and Actions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>reference features: planes, faces</li>
      <li>sketch entities: lines, circles, construction lines</li>
      <li>sketch relations: symmetric, equal, collinear, concentric, tangent, dimension</li>
      <li>feature operations: extrude, cut, mirror, radial and linear patterns</li>
      <li>assembly mates: coincident, concentric, distance, parallel</li>
      <li>number entry boxes: numeric input can include units and calculations</li>
      <li>hole wizard</li>
      <li>configurations</li>
      <li>view mates, isolate, suppress</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Some Good Heuristics</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Always sketch your parts on paper first.</li>

      <li>If you think it's time to start modeling, <em>wait</em> and do another
	paper sketch first.  It is so much faster and generative.</li>

      <li>If you need a standard component, check online sources for a free
	model before drawing it from scratch.  Be warned, though, that the exact
	part models may have much more detail than you need.  Modeling geometry
	is as much a process of knowing what to <em>leave out</em> for a
	particular problem.</li>

      <li>Choose a system of units and stick with it.  The reality of working in
	the USA is that metric and inch exist side by side throughout the
	catalogs and stock.  It can be cheaper to buy inch-sized parts and
	fasteners, but many imported parts are designed in millimeters.</li>

      <li>Before you begin modeling, consider the following: natural symmetries
	in the part, the core form which is most unlikely to change and thus
	suitable to be a base feature, whether the part may exist in several
	variations.</li>

      <li>It can be hard to appreciate the scale of a CAD feature as the
	computer monitor can perfectly magnify or shrink details.  I recommend
	keeping rulers and calipers handy for reference to remind you of exactly
	how much 0.001 inch or 0.1 mm actually looks in the world.</li>

      <li>A solid model defined by mathematical primitives is <em>mathematically
	  exact</em>.  Of course, any rendering of it as pixels, cutting line
	  segments, or rendered polygons is an approximation, and the precision
	  is ultimately limited by computer numerical representation.  But best
	  results are achieved by taking advantage of mathematical constraints
	  such as relations and mates to maintain that exactitude.  So for
	  example, it is possible just to visually position parts very closely
	  in an assembly without defining mates and have it look acceptable for
	  a drawing.  But these small errors will tend to cause problems later
	  when dimensions are slightly wrong in cut parts, and it defeats the
	  ability of the tool to help find errors such as overlapping
	  parts.</li>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>This repository includes sample parts and projects, see <a href="README.md">the README file.</a></p>

    <p>A complex snap-fit plastic robot assembly example is available for
      reference
      here: <a href="https://github.com/OrigamiRobotics/romibo-mechanism"><code>https://github.com/OrigamiRobotics/romibo-mechanism</code></a>.
      This was largely designed by Garth Zeglin, and demonstrates several ideas
      for creating 3-D structures from flat parts using interlocking joints.</p>
